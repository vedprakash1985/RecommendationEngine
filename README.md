# RecommendationEngine
Build Simple Recommendation Engine and visualization

## Outline

1. For the top 10 users (with more checkins), build
    1.  A basket of recommendation : venues(places), 
    1.  A list of likely venues (places) the user will visit based on their friends,
    1.  Where they will go next (with probability scores).

1. For the top 10 more “social” users (with more friends),
    1.  Draw the path (with map) of a week/month of users checkins,
    2.  List your friends and how close they are in terms of “taste” (based on venues visited
and ranked)
